# Image Decoder using SDL2

This project is a simple image decoder using SDL2 library. It reads a image and displays it on the screen.
Its main purpose is to learn how to use SDL2 library and how to decode various image formats. We write our 
own decoder for each format using the golang image interface, so we can take advantage of the image package.
